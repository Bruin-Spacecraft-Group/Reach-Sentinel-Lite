# Reach-Sentinel-Lite


## Quick start

1. First, you must download the following:
	 - download Django from the Django website, ideally for python-3: https://www.djangoproject.com/
	 - download Docker from the Docker website: https://hub.docker.com/?overlay=onboarding

2. Download the repo to a dedicated directory, ideally called **Reach-Sentinel-Lite**
	 - `git init`
	 - `git clone https://github.com/Bruin-Spacecraft-Group/Reach-Sentinel-Lite`

3. You should now see the files in your directory

4. Navigate into the repo you just cloned
	 - You should see the **Dockerfile** and **Makefile** files
	 - Make sure you have Docker successfully installed and running

5. To build and start the server, run: `make`

6. Open a browser and navigate to: http://0.0.0.0:8000/dashboard/
	 - The above link may not always work, so try this: http://0.0.0.0:8000/temp/
