# Reach-Sentinel-Lite


Quick start
-----------

1. First, download Django from the Django website, ideally for python-3: https://www.djangoproject.com/

2. Download the repo to a dedicated directory, ideally called **Reach-Sentinel-Lite**
	 - 'git init'
	 - 'git clone https://github.com/Bruin-Spacecraft-Group/Reach-Sentinel-Lite'

3. You should now see the files in your directory

4. Navigate into the repo you just cloned, then go into **reachSentinelLite**

5. To start the server, run: 'python3 manage.py runserver'
	 - You can also use simple 'python' to use python-2

6. Open a browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/testGraph/

7. The code is not perfect, but we'll get there!
